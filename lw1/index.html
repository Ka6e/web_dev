        Dark spruce forest frowned on either side the frozen waterway. The trees had been<br>
        stripped by a recent wind of their white covering of frost, and they seemed to lean<br> 
        towards each other, black and ominous, in the fading light. A vast silence reigned over<br> 
        the land. The land itself was a desolation, lifeless, without movement, so lone and cold<br> 
        that the spirit of it was not even that of sadness. There was a hint in it of laughter, but of a<br> 
        laughter more terrible than any sadness—a laughter that was mirthless as the smile of<br> 
        the sphinx, a laughter cold as the frost and partaking of the grimness of infallibility. It was<br> 
        the masterful and incommunicable wisdom of eternity laughing at the futility of life and<br> 
        the effort of life. It was the Wild, the savage, frozen-hearted Northland Wild.
        <p></p>
        But there was life, abroad in the land and defiant. Down the frozen waterway toiled a<br> 
        string of wolfish dogs. Their bristly fur was rimed with frost. Their breath froze in the air<br> 
        as it left their mouths, spouting forth in spumes of vapour that settled upon the hair of<br> 
        their bodies and formed into crystals of frost. Leather harness was on the dogs, and<br> 
        leather traces attached them to a sled which dragged along behind. The sled was without<br> 
        runners. It was made of stout birch-bark, and its full surface rested on the snow. The front<br> 
        end of the sled was turned up, like a scroll, in order to force down and under the bore of<br> 
        soft snow that surged like a wave before it. On the sled, securely lashed, was a long and<br> 
        narrow oblong box. There were other things on the sled—blankets, an axe, and a coffee-<br>
        pot and frying-pan; but prominent, occupying most of the space, was the long and<br> 
        narrow oblong box.
        <p></p>
        In advance of the dogs, on wide snowshoes, toiled a man. At the rear of the sled toiled a<br> 
        second man. On the sled, in the box, lay a third man whose toil was over,—a man whom<br> 
        the Wild had conquered and beaten down until he would never move nor struggle again.<br> 
        It is not the way of the Wild to like movement. Life is an offence to it, for life is<br> 
        movement; and the Wild aims always to destroy movement. It freezes the water to<br> 
        prevent it running to the sea; it drives the sap out of the trees till they are frozen to their<br> 
        mighty hearts; and most ferociously and terribly of all does the Wild harry and crush into<br> 
        submission man—man who is the most restless of life, ever in revolt against the dictum<br> 
        that all movement must in the end come to the cessation of movement.
        <p></p>
        But at front and rear, unawed and indomitable, toiled the two men who were not yet<br> 
        dead. Their bodies were covered with fur and soft-tanned leather. Eyelashes and cheeks<br> 
        and lips were so coated with the crystals from their frozen breath that their faces were<br> 
        not discernible. This gave them the seeming of ghostly masques, undertakers in a<br> 
        spectral world at the funeral of some ghost. But under it all they were men, penetrating<br> 
        the land of desolation and mockery and silence, puny adventurers bent on colossal<br> 
        adventure, pitting themselves against the might of a world as remote and alien and<br> 
        pulseless as the abysses of space.<p><b></b></p>
